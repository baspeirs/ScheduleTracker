## Installation
Use the package manager 
```bash
npm i
```

## Useage
```bash
on install and on deployment, you will need to seed the database with a schedule and a manager. The application uses one schedule object that will be updated as changes are made. Additionally, to prevent users from creating their own profile without being an employee, a manager must create employees when signed in. 
```
