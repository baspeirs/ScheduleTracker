This is a working schedule tracker application created for a local Jimmy Johns resturaunt. In the app, users are able to view the schedule, make time off requests, and if they are verified manager's, they can update the schedule, add and delete employees, and view entire employee directory. This application is used as a demonstration and is not being used by a client.

## Installation
Use the package manager 
```bash
npm i
```

## Useage
```bash
on install and on deployment, you will need to seed the database with a schedule and a manager. The application uses one schedule object that will be updated as changes are made. Additionally, to prevent users from creating their own profile without being an employee, a manager must create employees when signed in. 
```
